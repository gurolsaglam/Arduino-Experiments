This program is kind of a joke.
After Digispark has this program on it and is connected to a computer,
 it will keep moving the cursor to the south-most west-most corner,
 and then proceed to open the start menu, and turn off the computer,
 given that it has a windows 10 running on it.

But currently this is not working anymore, because after this program was written,
 a huge update came from microsoft and they changed the turn off
 button's place in the start menu. But it can still work with some minor changes.
