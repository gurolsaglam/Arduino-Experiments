BMP085 barometer datasheet
https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/BST-BMP085-DS000-05.pdf

(for the GY-88 that we currently have)
"I2C Scanner
Scanning...
I2C device found at address 0x1E  !
I2C device found at address 0x68  !
I2C device found at address 0x77  !
done"

---- IMPORTANT: If intented to use another sensor with I2C address 0x68,
-- then connect the AD0 pin to high (3V3), this will change the address to 0x69.
-- But do not forget to verify that with I2C Scanner beforehand.
-- If the device you have has 0x69 by default, connect the AD0 pin to low (GND),
-- this will change it to 0x68. Again, do not forget to verify with I2C Scanner.

Raspberry pi whole code (haven't tried)

The library can be found here:

In the MPU6050 line, the first three are acceleration, the other three are gyro.
For acceleration 1g = 9.80665 = 16384 in the serial port.
Gyro measurements should be 250 deg/sec.
HMC5883L is the magnetometer, I have not been able to try out the output data.
