"5a range of single-phase ac current sensor module for arduino"

To be able to use AC sensor we need the wire through which the
 alternate current is going to go through the hole in the sensor,
 as seen in the PNG file inside this folder.

Which is why the sensor is not useful for the mapper robot.
